// * javaScript explained through code.
// * use node.js to execute the code snippets.

// * everything in JS is an object.
// * correct myself - everything in JS "can become" an object - atleast they
//   can act like an object.

// * primitives are,
//      Number, String, Boolean, Function - they are literals that can 
//      become objects.
// * there are built-in types that are baked into the language, they are,
//      Array, Object ({}), RegExp, Date, Error
