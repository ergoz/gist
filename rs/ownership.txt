An owner has some privileges. It may:

* control resource deallocation,
* lend the resource, immutably (multiple borrows) or mutably (exclusive)
* hand over the ownership (with a move).

An owner has some restrictions, too:

* During a borrow, the owner may NOT (a) mutate the resource,
  or (b) mutably lend the resource.
* During a mutable borrow, the owner may NOT (a) access the resource,
  or (b) lend the resource.

A borrower has some privileges, too. In addition to accessing or mutating
the borrowed resource, a borrower may also share the borrow further:

* A borrower may share (copy) an immutable borrow.
* A mutable borrower may hand over (move) the mutable borrow.
  (Note that mutable reference is moved by default.)
