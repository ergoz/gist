// numeric literals can be annotated by adding the type as a suffix,
// with the exception of usize that uses the usize suffix and isize
// that uses isize siffix.

// the type of unsuffixed numeric literals will depend on how they
// are used. If no constraint exists, the compiler will use i32 for
// integers, and f64 for floating-point numbers.
