following are the fields that are coming from DCP_MUTATION message
  * key
  * by-seqno
  * rev-seqno
  * flags
  * expiration
  * lock-time
  * nmeta (I think extended meta-data is not applicable to mutations)
  * nru

All or some of the above fields might constitute as meta fields for
a document. Honestly, I don't know the meaning of each and every fields
but eventually the projector will call N1QL's expression evaluator as,

>    context := qexpr.NewIndexContext()
>    docval := qvalue.NewValue(doc)
>    key, err := expr.Evaluate(docval, context)

I would like to know whether or how the signature of expr.Evaluate()
will change to accomodate meta-fields for document evaluation.
