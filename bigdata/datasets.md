**Data-Science:** If something can be described with
[discrete mathematics][discrete-math] it can eventually be
understood by computers.

Following is a collection of datasets and source of datasets for data-sience.

**a. More than 1 TB**

* The 1000 Genomes project makes 260 TB of human genome [data][a.001] available.
* The Internet Archive is making an 80 TB web crawl [available][a.002] for
   research.
* The TREC conference made the [ClueWeb09][a.003] and [ClueWeb12][a.004] dataset
  vailable a few years back. You'll have to sign an agreement and pay a
  nontrivial fee to cover the sneakernet data transfer.
* CNetS at Indiana University makes a 2.5 TB click [dataset][a.005] available.
* ICWSM made a large corpus of [blog posts][a.006] available for their 2011
  conference. It's about 2.1 TB compressed.
* The ImageNet [dataset][a.007] is pretty big.
* [List of dataset][a.008] from Idiap Dataset Distribution Portal.
* [List of dataset][a.009] from Yahoo research.
* [Datasets][a.010] from github/google-research.
* [Dataset][a.011] from [statistical computing][http://stat-computing.org/]

**b. More than 1 TB**

* Curated data from [lemur project][lemur], [WebAP][b.001], Yahoo Non-Factoid
  Question [Dataset][b.002].
* Freebase Annotations for ClueWeb [this][b.003] and [this][b.004].
* Yandex has recently made a very large web search click [dataset][b.005]
  available.
* The Reference Energy Disaggregation [Data Set][b.006] has data on home energy
  use; it's about 500 GB compressed.
* The Tiny Images [dataset][b.007] has 227 GB of image data and 57 GB of metadata.
* Last and deprecated [data-dump][b.008] from Google's Freebase.
  A [blog][freebase-wikidata] on why google moved from freebase to wikidata.
* The Open American National Corpus [dataset][b.009].

**c. Wiki for one an all.**

[Wikidata][c.001] is a free knowledge base that can be read and edited by
both humans and machines.
[Wikicommons][c.002] a repository of media files, images, audio, video, etc..
[Wikipedia][c.003] the new age encyclopedia that world has come to depend on.

[Wikibooks][c.010] open content text books.
[Wikiversity][c.011] an university for learning.

**Kaggle** maintains a large set of datasets, competitions on data science
along with kernel of derived data from datasets. Refer to following links:

* How to use Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/docs
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
* https://www.kaggle.com/kernels

**Github**. Today the largest repository of computer programs are not with
microsoft, ibm, google or intel. It is with open-source and they do
social-coding with [github][http://github.com]. Github provides
[REST API][https://developer.github.com/v3/] and,
[GraphQL API][https://developer.github.com/v4/] to retrieve and hack with
github's data, not to mention the millions of repositories that can be cloned
and data-scienced.

**[Project Gutenberg][gutenberg]** one of the earliest repository of all text
books that are now free from copyright.

**There is a long running archival project from http://archive.org.**
